            The term burger can also be applied to a meat patty on its own. Since the term hamburger usually implies beef, for clarity burger may be prefixed with the type of meat or meat substitute used, as in beef burger, turkey burger, bison burger, or portobello burger. In most English-speaking countries, including the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, a piece of chicken breast in a bun is a chicken burger. Americans would call this a chicken sandwich because the meat is not ground, whereas in other countries, anything with a bun is considered a burger and a sandwich uses other types of bread (sliced bread, baguette...)

            Pasta can be made from either wheat or maida (refined wheat flour). While many pastas are made with durum wheat semolina, which is a coarser flour, some pastas are made with maida, a refined flour. Maida pasta tends to be softer and more delicate.
